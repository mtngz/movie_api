      <h1>myFlix Project: Marvelix</h1>
      <h2>Create a REST API with Node.js</h2>
    </header>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
      To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web
      application will provide users with access to information about different
      movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
      personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
